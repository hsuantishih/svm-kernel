# SVM Kernel Function Tricks

This repository is dedicated to testing various Support Vector Machine(SVM) kernel functions on different datasets. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regressioin task.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to explore and evaluate the performance of different SVM kernel functions across a range of datasets. By experimenting with various kernels, we aim to gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses in handling different types of data distributions.

## Datasets

The project utillizes a dataset sourced from [Social Network Ads](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads). This dataset is a A categorical dataset to determine whether a user purchased a particular product.

## SVM Kernel Functions

- Linear Kernel
- Polynomial Kernel
- Gaussian (RBF) Kernel
- Sigmoid Kernel
